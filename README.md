README-Generator

Description

This application generates a professional ReadMe based on inputs a user adds via the command line. Once Inquirer is installed, the user can enter "node index.js" in their VSCode Terminal to start the program. The user will then be prompted to answer questions regarding the name of the project, installation, usage, contribution, test, and questions. The user will be prompted to enter their GitHub account and their e-mail for the questions section. Once the final input is added a markdown will be generated utilizing their answers to create a professional Readme file. An example is contained in this repository titled test.md.
